    "### 1. Use a safe API\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to prevent SQL Injection vulnerabilities is the use of a safe API. It avoids using the interpreter entirely, provides a parameterized interface, or migrates to Object Relational Mapping Tools (ORMs). All this categorically limits risks from SQL Injection attacks and bolsters security a notch higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, we could securely fetch user data with a `mysql2` library supporting parameterized queries natively. Instead of string concatenation in SQL queries, we can replace the parts of the concatenation with placeholders denoted by `?`. The actual values will then be provided as a parameter to the query function. This approach ensures that user input is treated as data and never as executable code, thus avoiding SQL Injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how that would look in code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "async function getUserInfoNew(id) {\n",
    "    try {\n",

    "        \n",
    "        const [rows] = await pool.query('SELECT id, username, phone FROM users WHERE id = ? LIMIT 1', [id]); // use the parameterized interface\n",
    "        return rows[0];\n",
    "    } catch (error) {\n",

However, the third-party libraries can sometimes carry certain risks, particularly related to security vulnerabilities that might become exploited. Because of this, when dealing with projects requiring stricter security protocols, it could be safer to write your own custom validation methods.
